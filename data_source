This project uses synthetically generated personal finance data designed to closely mirror real-world
income, expense, budgeting, and savings behavior.

The dataset was intentionally created to:
• Avoid exposing sensitive or personally identifiable financial information
• Enable controlled testing of budgeting, cash-flow, and spending analysis scenarios
• Focus on database design, SQL logic, and financial insights rather than data collection

Transaction patterns (income frequency, expense categories, merchant usage, and budgets) were modeled
to reflect realistic monthly household spending behavior.
